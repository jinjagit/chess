# chess:
My (UNFINISHED) solution to the [final exercise of the Ruby Programming Unit](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-final-project), from the Odin Project.

The instructions, in a nutshell, are to build a "... command line Chess game where two players can play against each other. The game should be properly constrained."

I chose not to produce a command line app, but instead went for a more graphical approach using the ruby2D gem. While this gem is still a little rough around the edges (only at v 0.7), it is way more pleasant to look at, and can produce a much more user-friendly interface (with a little more work). So far, I have been very impressed with the ease-of-use of this gem.

Current state (01/11/18): Pieces constrained to legal moves (including taking moves, including en-passant), except for; not constrained by check (kinda important issue), and castling is not yet implemented. Detecting check will, hopefully, also lead to detection of checkmate, pins and validity of potential castling, and then a working game will be possible, though I expect it will take some work to optimize / make efficient.

White / Black alternation of moves is enforced, and a move list (both native and PGN format) is created as the 'game' progresses. The piece that moved is disambiguated in PGN format, when needed (e.g. 'Nbd7', rather than simply 'Nd7').

Note: At the moment, to run this (after downloading this repository), you'll need Ruby installed. Then, open a terminal, navigate to the root folder of the downloaded repository, and enter; <code>ruby sandbox.rb</code>

### Interesting issues to address:
  * Detecting 3-fold repetition (store and scan checksums on hashes of positions?)
  * Brute force calculation of legal moves only when player lifts piece, or by continually updating a list of all legal moves for each side (and working out how to minimize the updating process by calculating how every/any move does / might _not_ affect some other pieces)? EDIT (1/11/18): After some measurements of time taken to calculate 'legal' moves, the brute force approach is looking like it is probably adequate.
  * 50-move draw rule

### Features I want to add:
  * file ui, for saving a loading of both unfinished and finished games, in both app native and PGN formats.
  * step back / fwd through game (in progress, or completed)
  * ui niceties (e.g. coordinates on/off, piece points count, highlight King when in check, verbose mode, etc.)
  * Try doing more than just an 'AI' that plays a random move (as suggested in the 'Optional Extension'), but instead use a brute force look-ahead of a few ply (will still be an awful opponent!).
  * distributable executable (at least for Linux and OSX)
