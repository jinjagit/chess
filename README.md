# chess:
My (UNFINISHED) solution to the [final exercise of the Ruby Programming Unit](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-final-project), from the Odin Project.

The instructions, in a nutshell, are to build a "... command line chess game where two players can play against each other. The game should be properly constrained."

I chose not to produce a command line app, but instead went for a more graphical approach, using the ruby2D gem. While this gem is still a little rough around the edges (at only v 0.7), it is way more pleasant to look at than anything I could produce in the terminal, and enables a much more user-friendly interface (with a little more work). So far, I have been very impressed with the ease-of-use of this gem.

Current state (03/11/18): Pieces constrained to legal moves, including the effects of pins and check (both single and double-check). All legal moves are possible, including castling and en_passant. Checkmate is correctly detected (and the game halted when found).

A move list (both native and PGN format) is created as the 'game' progresses. The piece that moved is disambiguated in PGN format, when needed (e.g. 'Nbd7', rather than simply 'Nd7').

### To do next:
  * stalemate
  * pawn promotion
  * draw by 3-fold-repetition
  * flippable board

Note: At the moment, to run this (after downloading this repository), you'll need Ruby installed. Then, open a terminal, navigate to the root folder of the downloaded repository, and enter; <code>ruby sandbox.rb</code>

### Interesting issues to address:
  * Detecting 3-fold repetition (store and scan checksums on hashes of positions?)
  * Brute force calculation of legal moves only when player lifts piece, or by continually updating a list of all legal moves for each side (and working out how to minimize the updating process by calculating how every/any move does / might _not_ affect some other pieces)? EDIT (1/11/18): After some measurements of time taken to calculate 'legal' moves, the brute force approach is looking like it is probably adequate.
  * 50-move draw rule

### Features I want to add:
  * file ui, for saving / loading of both unfinished and finished games, in both app native and PGN formats.
  * step back / fwd through game (in progress, or completed)
  * ui niceties (e.g. coordinates on/off, piece points count, highlight King when in check, verbose mode, etc.)
  * Try doing more than just an 'AI' that plays a random move (as suggested in the 'Optional Extension'), but instead use a brute force look-ahead of a few ply (will still be an awful opponent!).
  * distributable executable (at least for Linux and OSX)

### Resources used:

  * [Chess MÃ©rida](https://marcelk.net/chess/pieces/merida/320/): Freeware. True Type Font, by Armando H. Marroquin, for diagrams and figurine notation.
  * [ruby2D gem](http://www.ruby2d.com/learn/get-started/): Tom Black: This entire project is open source under the MIT license.
  * [Ubuntu Fonts](https://design.ubuntu.com/font/): The licence allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely (providing certain conditions are met).

  # UI tests:

  * Fonts: try different ones / types & also different sizes
