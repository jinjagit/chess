# chess:
My solution to the [final exercise of the Ruby Programming Unit](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-final-project), from the Odin Project.

The instructions, in a nutshell, were to build a "... command line [pure Ruby] chess game where two players can play against each other. The game should be properly constrained." A secondary objective was to enable save, load, and continuation of an unfinished game, with an optional extra objective of creating a basic engine to play against a human.

I chose not to produce a command line app, but instead went for a more graphical approach, using the Ruby2D gem. While this gem is still a little rough around the edges (at only v 0.7), it is way more pleasant to look at than anything I could produce in a terminal, and enables a much more user-friendly interface (with a little more work). So far, I have been very impressed with the ease-of-use of this gem.

### Overview:

Pieces are always constrained to legal moves, including the restrictions of pins and check (both single and double-check). All legal moves are possible, including castling, pawn promotion and en-passant. Checkmate, stalemate, and draw due to insufficient material, are correctly detected (and the appropriate game result is enforced).

Draw conditions due to 50-move-rule (no captures or pawn moves) or 3-fold repetition of position are also detected and an option to claim the draw is presented. A draw can also be agreed manually, or declined by playing a move after a draw offer is made. The side to move can choose to resign.

A move list (in algebraic notation) is displayed as a game progresses. The piece that moved is disambiguated in algebraic notation, when needed (e.g. 'Nbd7', rather than simply 'Nd7'). Check, checkmate, piece capture, win, draw, en-passant and pawn promotion are also correctly formatted (in algebraic notation).

Games can be saved, loaded, and continued (if incomplete). The GUI is intuitive, and uses various visual effects and textual feedback to aid the player(s). Move sound effects and many other features are also included (see below, for detailed features list).

Note: Although this works well as an interface for two human players, it is primarily the solution to an exercise and was created solely to improve my Ruby programming and general coding / logic problem solving skills. If you actually want to play chess, import game files, &/or play against an engine, then you should probably choose a more capable app or on-line service (lichess.org is an excellent free to use resource, for example).

### Features:
  * highlight legal move squares, if any, (green squares) when piece is lifted
  * highlight king in check / checkmate (red square)
  * highlight last move (yellow squares: start-square & end-square)
  * pawn promotion menu: click-able choice of Q, R, N, or B.
  * side to move indicator
  * display of total pieces value (and difference) for each side - updates when piece taken / pawn promoted
  * information box: 'game in progress'; checkmate, stalemate and draw advice, etc.
  * advice + 'claim draw' option  when 3-fold-repetition / 50-move-rule conditions satisfied
  * draw by agreement - click to 'agree' or play on to decline
  * resign option - click to confirm or play on to cancel
  * flip board (and related UI elements + promotion menu, if displayed)
  * auto-flip - board flips to side to move, after every move
  * disable / enable coordinates
  * disable / enable highlighting of legal move squares
  * button hover effects and tool-tips
  * algebraic notation display
  * review of game moves (step fwd/back, go to start/end)
  * move / capture sound effects (sound can be disabled / enabled)
  * auto-save of game in progress (can be disabled / enabled)
  * manual save of game (incomplete or complete game)
  * load of saved complete and incomplete games (incomplete can be continued)

Note: At the moment, to run this (after downloading this repository), you'll need Ruby and the Ruby2D gem installed. Then, open a terminal, navigate to the root folder of the downloaded repository, and enter; <code>ruby chess.rb</code>

### Ruby2D issues & workarounds:
  Ruby2D seems to make great use of CPU to display elements:

  * shape objects use significantly more CPU than text (counter-intuitive)
  * using .add / .remove to show / hide is 10x slower than using z-axis (and hiding behind other graphic object(s)), but completely avoids the CPU hit otherwise incurred, without removing reference(s) to object instance(s)

  Thus, I replaced as many shape object instances, (64 squares to create a board image, for example), and some collections of text object instances, with .png images, and used .remove / .add wherever possible (rather than 'hiding' items using the z-axis). I will also rewrite the move list display method to concatenate text wherever possible into single lines (rather than each line being composed of three text instances).

  * text objects have poor anti-aliasing, which can result in a 90's style pixelation
  * text objects seem to be limited to single-line strings
  * creating 1000 text object instances causes crashes, whereas over 5000 shape instances do not
  * crashes when calling .remove / .add on many (200 to 300) text instances in an array
